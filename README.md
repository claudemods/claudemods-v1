another custom setup you could use is v1-base and v2-base with v2-kernels-rolling and v2-core
since v2-base doesnt contain the desktop packages this will keep the desktop stable but the system rolling

SigLevel = Never
Server = https://github.com/claudemods/claudemods-v1/releases/download/v2-kernels-rolling/


```





```
