today i built plasma dev desktop from my repos and set of packages the base repo link will be renamed shortly again as i need to test stable kde  

the aim is to make a tty installer which has options 4 ext4 and btrfs i will be supplying the home directory for stable kde desktop and dev

from now on my isos will let you install the base as ext4 or btrfs then download either the plasma desktop from stable or dev packages



for now my full setup installs fine from my latest repo packages im not going to fix my dev setup before making iso ect
